# Minecraft survival game
## _Created by Lucas Dziurzik_



I created this minigame to learn Spigot, the language used to create plugins and minigames on Minecraft Java Edition. You can start the game by typing /sgame.

On game start, you are teleported into a small arena and the first wave starts. 
Each wave has (2 * wavenumber) random monsters, + 1 blaze boss once wave number is superior to 3.
Some monsters receive a random speed buff and the "Speedy" prefix in their name.

Once you reach a kill milestone, you get a sword upgrade, then a bow and then a leather armor.
The game ends once wave 10 is beaten, or all players have died.
